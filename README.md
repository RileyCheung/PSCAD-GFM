# PSCAD-GFM
PSCAD studies into behaviour of grid-forming inverters for power system stability.

The original PSCAD model I received was from Farid at PSCAD, after inquiring about GFM-VSM models. The model was then modified to simplify the model and make parameters clearer. To speed up simulations pscad python automation and multiprocessing was used to vary short circuit level of grid model. This can be adapted to change variables. Matplotlib is currently used for plotting but can be changed in the future.
